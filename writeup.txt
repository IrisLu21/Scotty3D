    fully implemented 
    (noticed that there are self-intersection between faces when tangents cross but not sure if that is still manifold and how to check for that)

triangulation:

loop subdivision:

model:
    eagle/penguin/chick??? creature
    used a cylinder for the main body -> subdivided
    subdivided cube for head -> moved around vertices and edges to create beak and indents for the eyes
    subdivided and collapsed cubes for wings

Task 1:
    fully implemented

Task 2:
    fully implemented

Task 3:
    fully implemented

Task 4:
    I implemented it and am pretty sure that my code is correct in trace_ray, but my rendered objects come out all black since all the shadow rays are hitting an object (this doesn't work for a simple cube wiht a directional light above it). I'm not sure what is wrong and where I can fix this.

Task 5:
    fully implemented, but unable to be tested due to issue in task 4 (shadow rays)

Task 6 - 8:
    unimplemented
